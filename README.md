# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
Research Project on "Time Series Analysis and Forecasting"

## Time Series
* Time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals.

* Depending on the frequency of observations, a time series may typically be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual. Sometimes, we might have seconds and minute-wise time series as well, like, number of clicks and user visits every minute etc.

## Time Series Analysis
* Time series analysis involves understanding various aspects about the inherent nature of the series so that we are better informed to create meaningful and accurate forecasts.

## Time Series Forecasting
* Time Series forecasting is the process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time series based on past results.
